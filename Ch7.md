# Chapter 7: Atomic Structures
## Light
- made of electro-magnetic radiation
    - consequence of atomic structure
- waves of electric and magnetic fields that propagate and travel at right angles to each other

- Frequency -- cycles/sec (Hz)

## Electro-Magnetic (EM) Spectrum
- ranges from gamma to radio
- all EM travels at the same velocity
- E = hf
    - h -- Plank's constant
    - f -- frequency
- c (speed of light) in a vacuum = 2.998 x 10^8^ m/s
- c = $\lambda$ f
    - $\lambda$ -- wavelength

## In 1900
- matter and energy were seen as different
- matter -- particles
- energy -- waves

- Plank found mass and energy were connected
    - $\Delta$ E = nhf ($\Delta$ E in packets of hf)
    - h = 6.626 x 10^-34^ Jxs
    - these packets are called quanta
- Einstein called the quanta photons
- each photon has E = hf = (hc)/($\lambda$)
- combine this with E = mc^2^
    - (hc)/($\lambda$) = mc^2^
    - m = (h)/(c $\lambda$) (apparent mass of a photon)

## Wave Particle Duality
- waves act like matter
- matter acts like waves
- DeBroglie's wavelength
    - $\lambda$ = (h)/(mv)
- can be used to calculate the wavelength of an object

## Diffraction
- when light passes through thin slits, it diffracts due to interference

## Hydrogen Spectrum
- emission spectrum
- line spectrum
- few discrete lines
- only certain energies allowed
- use $\Delta$ E = hf = (hc)/($\lambda$)
- energy in the atom is quantized

## Niels Bohr
- developed the quantum model of the hydrogen atom
- described atoms as a solar system
- electrons attracted to nucleus because of opposite charges
- didn't fall into the nucleus because it was moving around

## The Bohr Ring Atom
- energy levels
    - different states of energy for electrons
    - add energy -> higher energy state
    - drop in energy state -> release of energy

(see figure for hydrogen model)

- E = -2.178 x 10^-18^ J (Z^2^/n^2^)
    - Z -- the atomic number of the atom
    - n -- the energy level
    - when the electron is removed n = $\infty$, E = 0
    - we are worried about the $\Delta$ E
    - $\Delta$ E = E~final~ - E~initial~
    - only true for mono-electric species
    - max energy at the nucleus

## The Quantum Mechanical Model
- a totally new approach
- DeBroglie -- matter like wave

### What's Possible
- only a standing wave if complete number of waves
- only certain allowed waves -> electrons
- 1925 -- Schroedinger described wave as a function
- this model requires a lot of math

### Schroedinger's Equation
- the wave function is F(x, y, z)
- solutions to the equations are called orbitals
- these are not Bohr orbits
- each solution tied to a certain energy
- there is a limit to what we can know (we can't know how the electron is moving)

### Heisenberg
- $\Delta$ x $\times$ $\Delta$ (mv) > (h)/(4 $\pi$)
    - $\Delta$ x -- the uncertainty in position
    - $\Delta$ (mv) -- the uncertainty in momentum
    - the minimum uncertainty possible is (h)/(4 $\pi$)

### Wave Function
- does not mean anything nothing concrete
- cannot be mapped visually
- the square of the function ($\psi$^2^) is the probability of finding an electron at a particular spot

(see figures)

### Defining the Size
- the modal service
- the size that encloses 90% of of the electron probability
- not a certain distance, but a most likely distance
- for the first solution, it is a sphere

### Quantum Number
- many solutions to Schroedinger's equation
- each solution can be described with quantum numbers that describe some aspect of the solution
- principal quantum number (n) -- size and energy of an orbital
    - int values > 0
- angular momentum quantum number l
    - shape of the orbital
    - int values from 0 to n - 1
- l = 0 is called s
- l = 1 is called p
- l = 2 -- d
- l = 3 -- f
- l = 4 -- g

### S Orbitals
- spheres
- sequentially larger

### P Orbitals

(see figure)

- oriented around different axes (p~x~, p~y~, p~z~)

### D Orbitals

(see figure)

### F Orbitals

(see figure)

- magnetic quantum number (m~l~)
- int values from -l to +l
- tells direction in each shape
- electron spin quantum numbers (m~s~)
- can have 2 values (+1/2, -1/2) (up, down)

### Polyelectronic Atoms
- more than one electron
- three E contribs
    - KE of moving electrons
    - PE between electrons and nucleus
    - PE from repulsion of electrons

- can't solve Schroedinger's equation exactly
- difficulty in repulsion of other electrons
- treat each electron as if it were affected by the net field of charge from the attraction of the nucleus and the repulsion of the electrons
- effective nuclear charge
    - can be calculated
        - E = -2.178 x 10^-18^ J x (Z~eff~^2^/n^2^)
        - and
        - E = -2.178 x 10^-18^ J x (Z~eff~^2^) x ((1/n~final~^2^) - (1/n~initial~^2^))
- developed independently by German Julius Lothar Meyer and Russian Dimitri Mendeleev (1870s)
- didn't know much about the atom
- put in columns by similar properties
- predicted properties of missing elements

### Aufbau Principle
- Aufbau -- German for building up
- as the protons are added up one by one, the electrons fill up the H like orbitals
- fill up in order of energy levels

(see figure for relative energy levels)

- valence electrons -- the electrons in the outermost energy levels (not d)
- core electrons -- the inner electrons
- Hund's rule - the lowest energy config for an atom is the max number of unpaired electrons in the orbitals

### Filling the Orbitals

(see figure)

- elements in the same column have the same electron configuration
- put in columns because of similar properties
- similar properties result from similar electron configs
- noble gases -> filled outer-shell
- transition metals -> filling d shell

#### Exceptions
- Ti = [Ar] 4s^2^ 3d^2^
- V = [Ar] 4s^2^ 3d^3^
- Cr = [Ar] 4s^1^ 3d^5^
- Mn = [Ar] 4s^2^ 3d^5^
- half-filled orbitals
- not clear why it happens
- same for Cu
- La = [Xe] 6s^2^ 5d^1^
- Ce = [Xe] 6s^2^ 4f^1^ 5d^1^
- Pm = [Xe] 6s^2^ 4f^3^ 5d^0^
- Gd = [Xe] 6s^2^ 4f^7^ 5d^1^

### More Polyelectronic
- we can use Z~eff~ to predic properties if we determine its pattern on the periodic table
- can use the amount of energy it takes to remove an electron for this
- ionization energy -- the energy necessary to remove an electron from a gaseous atom

- E = -2.18 x 10^-18^ x (Z^2^/n^2^)
    - true for the Bohr atom
    - can be derived for quantum model as sell

#### Remember the Simplified 

(see figure)

- ionization energy = (1310 kJ/mol) x (Z~eff~^2^/n^2^)
- so we can measure Z~eff~
- the ionization energy for a 1s electron from sodium is 1.39 x 10^5^ kJ/mol
- the ionization energy for a 3s electron from sodium is 4.95 x 10^2^ kJ/mol
- demonstrates sheilding

### Shielding
- electrons on the higher energy levels tend to be further out
- have to look through the other electrons to see the nucleus
- they are less affected by the nucleus
- lower effective nuclear charge
- if shielding were completely effective, Z~eff~ = 1

### Penetration
- there are levels to the electron distribution for each orbital

(see figures for orbital graphs)

### Penetration Effect
- the outer energy levels penetrate the inner energy levels so the shielding of the core is not totally effective
- from most penetration to least:
    - ns > np > nd > nf (within the same energy level)
- this is what gives us our order of filling, electrons prefer s and p

### How Orbitals Differ
- the more positive the nucleus, the smaller the orbital
- A Na 1s orbital is the same shape but smaller than an H 1s because the nucleus is more attractive
    - He 1s smaller as well

(see figure)

### Periodic Trends
- ionization energy -- the energy needed to remove an electron from a gaseous electron
- highest energy electron removed first
- first ionization energy (I~1~) is that required to remove the first electron
- 2nd ionization energy (I~2~) -- the 2nd electron
- for Mg
    - I~1~ = 735 kJ/mol
    - I~2~ = 1445 kJ/mol
    - I~3~ = 7230 kJ/mol (pull electron from noble gas configuration)
- the Z~eff~ increases as you remove electrons
- it takes much more energy to remove a core electron that a valence electron because there is less shielding
- generally, from left to right on the periodic table, I~1~ increases
    - greater z~eff~, same shielding
- as you go down a group, I~1~ decreases because the electrons are further away
- Z~eff~ also changes across a period
- Half-filled and filled orbitals are harder to remove electrons from

(see figure)

### Information Periodic Table
- know the special groups
- its the number and type of valence electrons that determine an atoms chemistry
- you can get the electron config
- metals lose electrons have the lowest ionization energy

#### Alkali Metals
- not including H
- decrease in ionization energy
- increase in radius
- decrease in density

### Reducing Ability
- lower ionization energy -> better reducing agent
- Cs > Rb > K > Na > Li
- works for solids but not aqueous solutions
- in solution; Li > K > Na
- its the water

### Hydration Energy
- its exothermic

### Line Spectra
- since each atom has specific energy levels, the transitions between them emit specific wavelengths of light

### Absorption Spectra
- the solar spectrum is almost complete, but has some lines
