# Nomenclature Review
1. name element or poly-atomic cation
2. name anion, changing a mono-atomic anions ending to-ide
- transition metals require roman numerals

## Covalent Molecules
- non-hydrocarbons
    1. name the first (least electronegative) element
    2. name the second (more electronegative) change to -ide
    - include Latin prefixes

## Diatomic Elements
- H, N, O, F, Cl, Br, I

## Counting to 10 in O-Chem

| Number of Carbons | Prefix | Alkane               |
|-------------------|--------|----------------------|
| 1                 | meth-  | CH~4~ -- methane     |
| 2                 | ethy-  | C~2~H~6~ -- ethane   |
| 3                 | prop-  | C~3~H~8~ -- ethane   |

| 10                | dec-   | C~10~H~22~ -- decane |

- -anes -- single bond
- -enes -- double bond
- -ynes -- triple bond
- double and triple within hydrocarbon chain are named by changing suffix when at least one exists
- indicate the position of the unsaturation with a number (eg 1-propene)

- (see figure)

## Naming Acids
- monoatomic ions and cyanide all end in -ide, their acid conjugates have the prefix hydro- and suffix -ic
    - HF -- hydrofluoric acid
    - HCN~3~ -- hydrocyanic acid
- polyatomic ions ending in -ate have acid conjugates with suffix -ic and no prefix
    - H~2~CO~3~ -- carbonic acid
- chlorine polyatomics end in in -ite and -ate, they have acid conjugates with suffixes -ous and -ic respectively
    - prefixes are only included if in the name of the anion
    - HClO -- hypochlorous acid
    - HClO~2~ -- chlorous acid
- nitrogen, sulfur and phosphorous: same as chlorine without prefixes
    - H~2~SO~4~ -- sulfuric acid
    - HNO~2~ -- nitrous acid

## Element Categories
- (see figure)

# Reactions

## Types of Reactions
- synthesis (combination) -- two or more elements combine to form one molecule
    - 2H~2~ + O~2~ -> 2H~2~O
- decomposition -- one molecule breaks up into two or more elements or smaller molecules
    - 2NaHCO~3~ -> Na~2~CO~3~ (sodium bicarbonate) + H~2~O + CO~3~
- combustion -- a molecule (usually a hydrocarbon) is combined with oxygen (in the presence of heat)
- single replacement -- a reactive metal atom replaces a less reactive metal ion in an ionic compound
    - 3CuSO~4~ + 2Al -> Al~2~(SO~4~)~3~ + 3Cu
- double replacement -- two ionic compounds switch cation and anion
    - AgNO~3~~(aq)~ + NaCl~(aq)~ -> AgCl~(aq)~ + NaNO~3~~(aq)~
           68

## Predicting Products
- if you can identify the type of reaction from the reactant you can often predict the products
    - N~2~ + 3H~2~ -> NH~3~ (synthesis) (under most conditions)

# Stoichiometry

## Moles
- relate to mass
    - mass = moles x molar mass
        - g = mol x g/mol
    - molarity = mol/liter
    - in ideal gases, 1 mol is 22.4 L
- stoichiometry -- the quantitative study of chemical reactions
    - ex mass~1~ -> mol~1~ -> mol~2~ -> mass~2~

## Percent Composition
- percent composition = $\frac{\text{molar mass element in compound}}{\text{molar mass compound}} \times 100$
- percent \ce{C} in \ce{CH4} = $\frac{\text{molar mass \ce{C} in \ce{CH4}}}{\text{molar mass \ce{CH4}}} \times 100 = \frac{\SI{12}{\gram} \ce{C}}{\SI{16}{\gram}} \times 100 = 75\%$

### Going Backwards
- using mass percents you can find the empirical formula (an empirical formula is the molecular formula \ce{C6H6 -> CH})

# Mixtures and Solutions
- mixture: a combination of two or more substances
    - heterogeneous: different in different parts
    - homogeneous: same throughout
    - suspension:
        - big particles settle to the bottom
        - smallest particles don't settle out, don't scatter light
    - colloid: medium particles that don't settle to the bottom but do scatter light
    - electrolyte: contains ion in solution, conducts electricity
    - non-electrolytes: contains molecules in solution, do not conducts electricity

## Properties of Solutions
- homogeneous mixture
- any two phases can be mixed
- there is no set composition
- concentration can be measured in:
    - mass percent
        - mass percent = $\frac{\text{mass solute}}{\text{mass solution}} \times 100$
    - percent solution
        - percent by volume = $\frac{\text{volume solute}}{\text{volume solution}} \times 100$ (if both are liquids)
        - percent $\frac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}} = \frac{\text{mass solution (\si{\gram}})}{\text{volume solution \si{\milli\litre}}} \times 100$ (if solute is solid)
    - molarity (M)
        - molarity = $\frac{\text{moles solute}}{\text{volume solution (\si{\litre})}}$
        - most common measure
    - mole fraction
        - mole fraction = $\frac{\text{moles solute}}{\text{moles solution}}$
    - molality (n)
        - molality = $\frac{\text{moles solute}}{\text{mass solvent (\si{\kilo\gram})}}$
    - normality (N)
        - normality = $\frac{\text{moles of equivalents}}{\text{volume solution (\si{\litre})}}$
        - for acids
- concentrated: lots of solute in a given amount of solvent
- dilute: little solute in a given amount of solvent

### Dilution
- what do you do to a solution to make it more dilute?
- remove solute *or* add water
- if moles stay constant
    - mole~1~ = mole~2~
    - moles = molarity $\times$ volume
    - then $M_{1}V_{1} = M_{2}V_{2}$

### Factors that Affect the Rate of Solubility
- heat
- stirring
- crushing (surface area)

### Energy of Solution Formation
1. separate solute into its components
2. separate the solvent molecules
3. allowing the solute and solvent to interact

### Heat of Solution
- $\Delta H_{soln}$
- $\Delta H_{1}$ = intermolecular forces of solute
- $\Delta H_{1}$ = intermolecular forces of solvent
- $\Delta H_{1}$ = solvation energy gained by new forces
- $\Delta H_{soln}$ = total energy of solution

- energy diagrams: show energy levels of chemical states
