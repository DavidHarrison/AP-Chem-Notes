# Chapter 5: Gases

## Kinetic Molecular Theory

## Assumptions
1. gas molecules are very small, but have mass
2. gas molecules are very far apart
3. gas molecules are in constant rapid motion
4. collisions between gas molecules are elastic
5. the average kinetic energy of the gases depends on their temperature
6. gas molecules are not attracted to each other

## Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution
- distribution of velocities is broadened by temperature

## Pressure
- gas molecules are everywhere colliding

### Atmospheric Pressure
- constant pressure from atmosphere

### Measuring Pressure
- barometer
- manometer

#### Units
- (mm Hg)/torr (same)
- atm
- kPa (SI unit)
- lb/in^2^ (psi)

- 1 atm = 760 mm Hg
- 1 atm = 14.7 psi
- 1 atm = 101 kPa

## Gas Laws

### Boyle's Law
- Robert Boyle -- measured effects of trapped gases
- $PV = PV$ ($PV = k$)
    - as pressure increases, volume decreases (inverse relationship)
- pressure is created by millions of tiny collisions

### Charles' Law
- $\frac{V_{1}}{T_{1}} = \frac{V_{2}}{T_{2}}$
    - direct relationship between temperature and volume
- temperature ($T$) in proportion with kinetic energy ($KE$), proportional with volume ($V$)

### Avogadro's Law
- at constant pressure, volume is directly proportional to the amount of gas
- $\frac{V_{1}}{n_{1}} = \frac{V_{2}}{n_{2}}$
- molar volume of gas: 1 mol = 22.4 L at STP

### Ideal Gas Law
- $PV = nRT$
    - $P$ -- pressure (atm)
    - $V$ -- volume (L)
    - $n$ -- moles (mol)
    - $R$ -- universal gas constant (\SI{0.821}{\litre\atmosphere\per\mole\per\litre})
    - $T$ -- temperature (K)
- $\frac{P_{1}V_{1}}{T_{1}n_{1}} = \frac{P_{2}V_{2}}{T_{2}n_{2}}$ (ultimate combined gas law)
- if this is always true, the ideal gas law must be equal to a constant R.

- molar volume of an ideal gas at STP is 22.42 L
    - STP (temperature and pressure)
- condition of $0^{\circ}$ at 1 atm

### Partial Pressures
- Dalton's Law: the total pressure is equal to the sum of the pressures of individual gases
    - $P_{\text{total}} = P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} ... = \sum\limits_{i=1}^n P_{i}$
    - assuming constant $V$ and $T$
        - $P_{\text{total}} = (\sum\limits_{i=1}^n n_{i}) \times \frac{RT}{V}$

#### Mole Fraction
- mole fraction = $\frac{\text{moles of one component}}{\text{total moles}}$
    - $x_{1} = \frac{n_{1}}{n_{\text{total}}}$
    - for gases (assuming constant $V$ and $T$):
        - $x_{1} = \frac{P_{1}}{P_{\text{total}}}$

#### Our Atmosphere
- 80% nitrogen
- 18% oxygen
- 1.5% argon
- 0.2% water
- 0.3% carbon dioxide

### Gas Movement
- since gases are in constant rapid motion and they are far apart, they will always flow from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure
    - this creates weather

### Derivation of Ideal Gas Law
- $P = \frac{2}{3}\frac{nN_{A}(\frac{1}{2}mu^{2})}{V}$
    - $P$ -- pressure of the gas
    - $n$ -- number of moles
    - $N_{A}$ -- Avogadro's number
    - $m$ -- mass of each particle
    - $u^{2}$ -- average of the square of the velocities of the particles
    - V -- volume of the container
- $KE_{\text{avg}} = N_{A}(\frac{1}{2}mu^{2})$
- $P = \frac{2}{3}\frac{n(KE)_{\text{avg}}}{V}$ or $\frac{PV}{n} = \frac{2}{3}KE$
- $\frac{PV}{n} = \frac{2}{3}KE_{\text{avg}} \propto \text{ (proportional to) } T$ or $\frac{PV}{n} \propto T$

### The Meaning of Temperature
- $KE_{\text{avg}} = \frac{3}{2}RT$
- kelvin temperature is an index of the random motion of gas particles (higher $T$ $\rightarrow$ higher $KE$)

### Root Mean Square Velocity
- the square root of $u^{2}$ called the root mean square velocity and is symbolized by $u_{\text{rms}}$
- $u_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{u^{2}}$
- $KE_{\text{avg}} = N_{A}(\frac{1}{2}mu^{2})$ and $KE_{\text{avg}} = \frac{3}{2}RT$
- $N_{A}(\frac{1/2}mu^{2}) = \frac{3}{2}RT$ or $u^{2} = \frac{3RT}{N_{A}m}$
- $\sqrt{u^{2}} = u_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{N_{A}m}}$
- $u_{\text{rms}} = \sqrt{\frac{3RT}{m}}$
- remember to convert $R$ to joules

## Effusion and Diffusion
- diffiusion: describes the mixing of gases
    - substitutional -- pushes an atom out of the way
    - interstitial -- moves into empty space of atoms
    - rate of diffusion describes the rate of mixing gases
- effusion: the passage of a gas through a tiny hole
    - Graham's Law
        - $\frac{\text{rate}_{1}}{\text{rate}_{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{M_{1}}{M_{2}}}$
        - the more gas a mass has, the longer it takes to effuse
    - the lighter a gas is
        - the faster it moves
        - the more collisions it makes
        - the more likely they will collide with the whole
    - rate proportional to temperature

- does it work for diffusion as well?
    - $\frac{\text{distance}_{1}}{\text{distance}_{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{M_{1}}{M_{2}}}$
        - distance is the distance traveled to meet the other gas along a tube
    - it does, but not exactly (more going on)

## Ideal Gases
- the assumption made by the ideal gas law
    - gases take up no volume
    - gases have no intermolecular attractions
- there are good assumptions, especially
    - at low densities (their volume is small compared to the total volume)

### Real Gases
- faulty assumption #1:
    - gases take up no volume
        - real gases have volume
        - therefore gases have less space to travel in than the entire container
        - the bigger the gas molecule, the bigger the effect
- faulty assumption #2:
    - gases are not attracted to each other
        - real gases are attracted to each other
        - they don't bounce perfectly, so they don't hit as hard
        - this makes the actual pressure less than assumed (ideal)
        - the more polar or larger the gas, the greater the effect

### Major Distinction
- effusion and diffusion rate rely only on the mass of the gas molecules
- ideal behaviour relies on
    a. volume of the gas
    b. polarity of the gas
