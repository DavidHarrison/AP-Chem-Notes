# Chapter 4: Types of Reactions and Solution Stoichiometry

## Polarity
- if there is an imbalance of electrical charge between different poles of the molecule, it is polar

## Entropy
- disorder more probable than order
- therefore, solubility is favored
- it is not the only factor

### Like Dissolves Like
- polar dissolves polar, non-polar dissolves non-polar
- polar does not dissolve non-polar, non-polar does not dissolve polar

## Solubility
- only if either $\Delta H_{solvation}$ is more negative than $\Delta H_{1}$ and $\Delta H_{2}$ combined are positive
- *or* the disorder is sufficient to overcome the $\Delta H_{solvation}$

### Solubility Curves
- generally solubility goes up with temperature (excepting of gases)

# Solubility Rules
- Rules 1-6 must be applied in order. Earlier rules take precedence.
1. Soluble: all ammonium (\ce{NH4+}) and group IA Salts
2. Soluble: all nitrates (\ce{NO3-}), acetates (\ce{CHCOO-}) and perchlorates (\ce{ClO4-})
3. Insoluble: all silver (\ce{Ag+}), lead (\ce{Pb+}) and mercury(I) (\ce{Hg2^{2+}}) salts
4. Soluble: all chlorides (\ce{Cl-}), bromides (\ce{Br-}) and iodides (\ce{I-})
5. Insoluble: all carbonates (\ce{CO3^{2-}}), chromates (\ce{CrO4^{2-}}), phosphates (\ce{PO4^{3-}}), sulfides (\ce{S^{2-}}), oxides (\ce{O^{2-}}), hydroxides (\ce{OH-})\\
    - Exceptions:
    - Group II chromates are soluble except \ce{BaCrO4}
    - Group IIA hydroxides are soluble except \ce{Mg(OH)2}
6. Soluble: all sulfates, except barium sulfate (\ce{BaSO4}), calcium sulfate (\ce{CaSO4}) and strontium sulfate (\ce{SrO4})

- with a few exceptions, the solubility rules permit assuming:
    - a salt with an anion of 1- charge is soluble
        - these salts will completely dissociate into ions.
    - salts with anions of 2- or 3- charge are insoluble
        - except for certain sulfates, these salts will precipitate

## Solubility Theater Consequences
- too much salt -- not enough water to surround it -- saturated solution
- break up a crystal -- more surface area -- dissolves faster
- increased temperature -- molecules move faster -- dissolves faster
- agitate the solution -- molecules can interact more -- dissolves faster
- non-polar solute -- salt isn't attracted -- doesn't dissolve in water

## Electrolytes
- electricity is moving charge
- the ions that are dissolved can move
- solutions of ionic compounds can conduct electricity

## Types of Solutions
- strong electrolytes completely dissociate (split into ions)
    - many ions -- conducts well
- weak electrolytes -- partially dissociate
    - few ions -- conduct electricity slighty
- non-electrolytes -- don't dissociate
    - no ions -- don't conduct
    - polar non-ionic
- acids -- form \ce{H+} ions when dissolved
    - strong acids dissociate completely
    - many ions
    - \ce{H2SO4}, \ce{HNO3}, \ce{HCl}, \ce{HBr}, \ce{HI}, \ce{HClO4}
- weak acids -- don't dissociate completely
- bases -- form \ce{OH-} ions when dissolved
    - strong bases -- many ions
    - \ce{KOH}, \ce{NaOH}

# Three Types of Equations
- molecular equation -- written as whole formulas, not ions
    - \ce{K2CrO4_{(aq)} + Ba(NO3)2_{(aq)} -> K2(NO3)2_{(aq)} + BaCrO4_{(s)}}
- complete ionic equation -- shows dissolved electrolytes as ions
    - \ce{2K^{+} + CrO4^{2-} + Ba^{2+} + 2NO3^{-} -> BaCrO4_{(s)} + 2K^{+} + 2NO3^{-}}
    - spectator ions are those that don't react
- net ionic reaction -- shows only those ions that react not the spectator ions
    - \ce{CrO4^{2-} + Ba^{2+} -> BaCrO4_{(s)}}

# Types of Reactions
## Acid-Base
- for our purposes, an acid is a proton donor
- a base is aproton acceptor (usually \ce{OH-})
- \ce{H+_{(aq)} + OH-_{(aq)} -> H2O_{(l)}}
- acid + base \ce{->} salt + water
- often called a neutralization reaction because the acid neutralizes the base
- often titrate to determine concentration 
    - solution of known concentration (tritrant)
    - is added to the unknown (analyte)
    - until the equivalence point is reached

### Titration
- where the indicator changes color is the endpoint
- not always at the equivalence point
- number of \ce{H+} ions $\times M_{A} \times V_{A}$ = number of \ce{OH-} ions $\times M_{B} \times V_{B}$

## Oxidation-Reduction (Redox)
- ionic compounds are formed through the transfer of electrons
- an oxidation-reduction reaction involves the transfer of electrons

### Oxidation States
- a way of keeping track of the lectrons
- not necessarily true in nature, but it works
- need rules for assigning (memorize)
    1. the oxidation state of elements in their standard state is zero
    2. oxidation states for monoatomic ions are the same as their charge
    3. oxygen is assigned an oxidation state of -2 in covalent compounds, except as peroxide (-1)
    4. in compounds with nonmetals, hydrogen is assigned +1
    5. in its compounds, fluorine is always -1
    6. the sum of the oxidation states must be zero in compounds or equal to the charge of the ion

### Redox
- transfer electrons, so the oxidation state changes
- oxidation is the loss of electrons
    - \ce{CH4 + 2O2 -> CO2 + H2O}
        - hydrogen is oxidized
        - oxygen is reduced
- reduction is the gain of electrons
- OIL RIG -- oxidation is loss, reduction is gain
- LEO GER -- loss of electrons is oxidation, gain of electrons is reduction
- oxidation means an increase in the oxidation state
- reduction means a decrease in the oxidation state
- the substance that is oxidized is called the reducing agent
- the substance that is reduced is called the oxidizing agent
- \ce{Fe_{(s)} + O2_{(g)} -> Fe2O3_{(s)}}
    - \ce{Fe} -- reducing agent, with oxidation state of 0
    - \ce{O} -- oxidizing agent, with oxidation state of 0
    - \ce{Fe^{3+}} -- oxidation state of 3+
    - \ce{O^{2-}} -- oxidation state of 2-

### Balancing Redox Equations
- in aqueous solutions, the key is the number of electrons produced must be the same as those required
- for reactions in acidic solution, an 8 step procedure
    1. write seperate half reactions
    2. for each half freaction balance all reactants except \ce{H} and \ce{O}
    3. balance \ce{O} using \ce{H2O}
    - acidic solution
    4. balance using \ce{H+}
    5. balance chare using \ce{e-}
    6. multiply equations to make electrons equal
    7. add equations and cancel identical species
    8. check that the charges and elements are balanced

### Half Reactions
- all redox reactions can be thought of as happending in two halves
- one produces electrons (oxidation half)
- the other requires electrons (reduction half)
