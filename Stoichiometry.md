# Stoichiometry
## Moles
- relate to mass
    - mass = moles x molar mass
        - g = mol x g/mol
    - molarity = mol/liter
    - in ideal gases, 1 mol is 22.4 L
- stoichiometry -- the quantitative study of chemical reactions
    - ex mass~1~ -> mol~1~ -> mol~2~ -> mass~2~

## Percent Composition
- % composition = (molar mass element in compound) / (molar mass compound) x 100%
- % C in CH~4~ = (molar mass C in CH~4~) / (molar mass CH~4~) = (12 g C) / (16 g) = 75%
