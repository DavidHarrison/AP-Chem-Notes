# Chapter 10: Liquids and Solids
- they are similar
    - compared to gases
    - incompressible
    - their density does not change much with temperature
    - these similarities are due
        - to the molecules being close together in solids and liquids
        - and far apart in gases
- liquids and solids are held together by *intermolecular* forces
    - refers to the forces between molecules
    - these are what hold the molecules together in condensed states
- strong intermolecular forces
    - covalent bonding
    - ionic bonding
- weak intermolecular forces
    - dipole-dipole interactions
    - London dispersion forces
- during phase changes, the molecules stay intact
- energy is used to overcome intermolecular forces

## Dipole-Dipole
- remember where the polar definition came from?
- molecules line up in the presence of an electric field. The opposite ends of the dipole can attract each other so the molecules stay close together
- 1% as strong as covalent bonds

## Hydrogen Bonding
- especially strong dipole-dipole forces when H is attached to F, O or N
- these three because
    - high electronegativity
    - small enough to get close
- affects boiling point (see figure)

### Water
- see figure

## London Dispersion Forces
- non-polar molecules also exert forces on each other
- otherwise, there would be no solids or liquids
- electrons are not evenly distributed at every instant in time
- temporary forces can exist when electrons randomly align to form change or when charge induced by an outside force
- induces a dipole in the atom next to it
- induced dipole-dipole interaction
- weakest of the forces
- short lived
    - come and go
    - lasts longer at low temperature
        - eventually long enough to condense gas
- bigger molecules -> higher melting and boiling points
- also called Van der Waal's forces

## Liquids
- many properties due to internal attraction of atoms
    - beading
    - surface tension
    - capillary action
- stronger intermolecular forces cause each of these to increase

### Surface Tension
- molecules in the middle are attracted in all directions
- molecules at the top are only pulled inward
- minimizes surface area

### Capillary Action
- liquids spontaneously rise in a small tube
- intermolecular forces are cohesive, connecting like things
- adhesive forces connect to something else
- Ex
    - glass is polar, it attracts water

### Beading
- if a polar substance is placed on a non-polar surface
    - there are cohesive forces
    - no adhesive forces
(see figure)

### Viscosity
- how much a liquid resists flowing
- large forces result in greater viscosity
- large molecules can get tangled up
- cyclohexane has a lower viscosity than hexane
    - because its circular, more compact
(see figure)

- stronger forces, bigger effect
    - hydrogen bonding
    - polar bonding
    - LDF

### Model
- can't see molecules so picture them as spheres
- in motion but attracted to each other
- with regions arranged like solids but
    - with higher disorder
    - with fewer holes than a gas
    - highly dynamic, regions changing between types

## Phases
- the phase of a substance is determined by three things
    - temperature
    - pressure
    - strength of the IMFs

## Solids
- two major types
- amorphous - those with much disorder in their structure
- crystalline - have a regular arrangement of components in their structure
- there are many amorphous solids (eg glass)
- we tend to focus on crystalline solids
    - two types
        - ionic solids have ions at the lattice points (eg salt)
        - molecular solids have molecules at the lattice points (eg sugar)

### Crystals
- lattice - three dimensional grid that describes the locations of the pieces in a crystalline structure
- unit cell - the smallest repeating unit in the lattice
- three common types
    - cubic (1 atom unit cell) (see figure)
    - body-centered cubic (2 atom unit cell) (see figure)
    - face-centered cubic (4 atom unit cell) (see figure)

## Metallic Bonding
- when energy of empty/filled MOs is similar, electrons can move around
    - eg Mg 3s & 3p overlap
        - electrons in these energy levels can travel freely
    - makes metals conductors
    - malleable because bonds are flexible

### Carbon - A Special Atomic Solid
- four types of solid carbon
    - amorphous (eg coal)
    - diamond
        - hardest natural substance
        - insulates both heat and electricity
            - filled MOs separated by large energy gap from empty MOs
        - each C is sp^3^ hybridized (connected to 4 other C)
        - carbon atoms locked in tetrahedral shape
        - strong $\sigma$ bonds give hardness, strength
    - graphite
        - slippery
        - conducts electricity
        - each C is connected to 3 other Cs and sp^2^ hybridized
        - the molecule is flat with 120$^{\circ}$ angles in fused 6 member rings
        - the $\pi$ bonds extend above and below the plane
            - this overlap forms a huge *$\pi$ bonding network*
            - electrons are free to move throughout the delocalized orbitals
            - these layers slide by each other
    - fullerenes
        - flexible soccer bals and tubes
        - relatively recent (1970s)

## Molecular Solids
- molecules occupy the corners of the lattices
- different molecules can have different forces between them
- these forces depend on the size and nature of the dipoles
- they also depend on the strength and nature of dipole moments
- those without dipoles
    - most are gases at 25$^{\circ}$ C (room temperature)
    - the only forces are LDF
        - depend on the size of the atom (large molecules (like I~2~) can be solids even without dipoles)

- **dipoles hold molecules together**

- those with dipoles
    - dipole-dipole forces are generally stronger than LDF
- **Hydrogen bonding** is stronger than dipole-dipole forces
- no matter how strong the intermolecular forces, it is always much, much weaker than the forces in bonds
- stronger IMF -> higher freezing point

### Water is Special
- each molecule has 2 polar O-H bonds
- this gives water an especially high melting & boiling point
- each molecule has two lone pairs on its O
- each O can in interact with 4 H atoms

## Ionic Solids
- the extremes in dipole dipole forces - atoms are actually held together by opposite charges
- huge melting points and boiling points
- atoms are locked in lattice so hard and brittle
- every electron is accounted for so they are poor conductors (good insulators)

## Vapor Pressure
- vaporization - change from liquid to gas at boiling point
- evaporation - change from liquid to gas below boiling point
- Heat (enthalpy) of vaporization ($\Delta$ H~vap~)
    - the energy required to vaporize 1 mol at 1 atm
- vaporization is an endothermic process (requires heat)
- energy is required to overcome IMFs
- responsible for cool earth
- why we sweat

## Condensation
- change from gas to liquid
- achieves dynamic equilibrium with vaporization in a closed system
- closed system -> no flow of heat

## Dynamic Equilibrium
- when first sealed the molecules gradually escape the surface of the liquid
- as the molecules build up above the liquid, some condense back to the fluid
- as time goes by, rate of vaporization remains constant, condensation increases
- in DE, rate of vap. = rate of cond.
- molecules are constantly changing phase ("dynamic")
- total amount of liquid and vapor are constant ("equilibrium")

## Vapor Pressure
- the pressure above the liquid at equilibrium
- liquids with high vapor pressures evaporate easily, they are called volatile
- decreases with increasing IMFs
- bigger molecules (bigger LDF)
- more polar molecules (dipole-dipole)
- increases with increasing temp.
- easily measured in a barometer

- Barometer - P~atm~ = P~Hg~ + P~vap~

## Temperature Effect
- energy needed to overcome IMFs
- evaporation can take place at T < boiling point because of energy in its surroundings
- at higher T, more molecules have enough energy -- higher vapor pressure
- ln|P~T1vap~ / P~T2vap~| = (- $\Delta$ H~vap~ / R) x (1/T~1~ - 1/T~2~)
    - $\Delta$ H~vap~ -- heat of vaporatization (J/mol)
    - R -- universal gas constant (8.3145 J/K mol)
    - graph is a straight line

## Changes of State
- the graph of temperature versus heat applied is called a heating curve
- the temperature a solid turns to a liquid is the melting point
- the energy required to accomplish this change is called the *heat* (or enthalpy) *of fusion*

(see figure)

## Melting Point
- melting point is determined by the vapor pressure of the solid and the liquid
- at the melting point, the vapor pressure of the solid = vapor pressure of liquid
- if P~vap solid~ > P~vap liquid~, solid must release molecules to achieve equilibrium -> melt
    - can only happen above freezing point
- if P~vap liq~ > P~vap solid~ -> liquid releases molecules to maintain equilibrium
    - T must be below the freezing point

## Boiling Point
- reached when the vapor pressure equals the external pressure
- normal boiling point is the boiling point is the boiling point at 1 atm
- super heating -- heating above the boiling point (no nucleation points (very smooth))
- super cooling -- cooling below the freezing point

## Phase Diagrams
- a plot of T vs P for a closed system with lines to indicate where there is a phase change

(see figure)

- for water, density of solid H~2~O < liquid H~2~O resulting in line solid-liquid transition with negative slope
- for CO~2~ (and most other molecules), the density for the solid is greater than that of the liquid, meaning the transition line has positive slope
