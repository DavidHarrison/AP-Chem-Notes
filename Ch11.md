# Chapter 11: Solutions
- occur in all phases
- the solvent does the dissolving (usually the biggest component)
- solute is dissolved
- examples of all types of solvents dissolving all types of solutes
- molarity = (mol solute)/(liter solution) (abbr. M)
- % mass = (mass solute)/(mass solution) * 100
- mole fraction of component A
    - $\chi$~A~ = N~A~/N~B~
- molality = (moles solute)/(kilograms solution) (abbr. m)
- normality -- read, don't focus on

## Energy of Making Solutions
- heat of solution ($\Delta$H~soln~) --> energy change for making soln
- steps:
    - break apart solvent (overcome attractive fores; $\Delta$H~1~ > 0)
    - break apart solute (overcome attractive fores; $\Delta$H~2~ > 0)
    - mix solute and solvent (depends on what is mixing; $\Delta$H~3~ < 0)
- molecules attract --> highly negative $\Delta$H
- molecules can't attract --> low negative $\Delta$H
- (see diagram)
- if $\Delta$H~soln~ is small and positive, a solution will still form because of entropy
- if there are many more ways for them to mix --> favored
- "like dissolves like"
    - water soluble molecules must have dipole moments (polar bonds)
    - to be soluble in non-polar, molecules must be non-polar
- changing the pressure doesn't affect the amount of solid or liquid that dissolves
    - they are incompressible
- pressure affects the amount of gas that can dissolve in a liquid
- increased pressure --> increased rate of solution
- equilibrium disturbed --> new equilibrium w/ more gas dissolved

## Henry's Law
- P = kC
    - where
        - P = pressure
        - k -> constant
        - C = concentration

## Temperature Effects
- increased temperature --> increased rate of solution
- can't predict whether it will increase the amount of solid that dissolves
- gases are predictable
    - increased temperature --> decreased solubility
    - gas molecules with enough KE can escape
    - thermal pollution can be caused by this

## Vapor Pressure of Solutions
- a non-volatile solvent lowers the vapor pressure of water
- the molecules of the solvent must overcome the force of both the other solvent molecules and the solute molecules

## Raoult's Law
- P~soln~ = $\chi$~solvent~ x P~solvent~
- vapor pressure of solvent = (mole fraction solvent) x (pressure of pure soln)
