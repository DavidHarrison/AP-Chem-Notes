# Reactions
## Types of Reactions
- synthesis (combination) -- two or more elements combine to form one molecule
    - 2H~2~ + O~2~ -> 2H~2~O
- decomposition -- one molecule breaks up into two or more elements or smaller molecules
    - 2NaHCO~3~ -> Na~2~CO~3~ (sodium bicarbonate) + H~2~O + CO~3~
- combustion -- a molecule (usually a hydrocarbon) is combined with oxygen (in the presence of heat)
- single replacement -- a reactive metal atom replaces a less reactive metal ion in an ionic compound
    - 3CuSO~4~ + 2Al -> Al~2~(SO~4~)~3~ + 3Cu
- double replacement -- two ionic compounds switch cation and anion
    - AgNO~3~~(aq)~ + NaCl~(aq)~ -> AgCl~(aq)~ + NaNO~3~~(aq)~

## Predicting Products
- if you can identify the type of reaction from the reactant you can often predict the products
    - N~2~ + 3H~2~ -> NH~3~ (synthesis) (under most conditions)
