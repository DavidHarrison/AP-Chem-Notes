# Chapter 12: Kinetics
- the study of reaction rates
- spontaneous reactions are reactions that will happen -- but we can't tell how fast
    - diamond will spontaneously turn to graphite, but it will take a very long time
- **reaction mechanism** - the steps by which a reaction takes place

## Reaction Rates
- rate = $\frac{\text{concentration of A at }t_2 - \text{concentration of A at }t_1}{t_2 - t_1}$
- rate = $\frac{\frac{\Delta A}{\Delta t}}{\frac{\Delta A}{\Delta t}}$
- change in concentration per unit time
- for this reaction
    - \ce{N2 + 3H3 -> 2NH3}
    - (see figure)

## Calculating Rates
- average rates are taken over long intervals
- instantaneous rates are determined by the derivative of the amount of material
- instantaneous slope method
- we can define rate in terms of the disappearance of the reactant or in terms of the rate of appearance of the product
    - \ce{N2 + 3H3 -> 2NH3}
    - $\frac{-\Delta \ce{N2}}{\Delta t} = \frac{-3 \Delta \ce{H2}}{\Delta t} = \frac{2 \Delta \ce{NH3}}{\Delta t}$

## Rate Laws
- reactions are reversible
- as products accumulate, the can begin to turn back into reactants
- early on, the rate will depend on only the amount of reactants present
- we want to measure the reactants as soon as they are mixed
- this is called the **initial rate method**

- two key points
    - the concentration of products do not appear in the rate law because this is an initial rate
    - the order must be determined experimentally
    - *can't* be obtained from the equation
    - empirically determined

- \ce{2NO2 -> 2NO + O2}
- the rate only depends on the concentration of the reactants
- rate = $k[\ce{NO2}]^n$
    - called *rate law expression*
        - k -- rate constant
        - n -- order of the reactant; usually a positive integer
- the rate of appearance of \ce{O2} can be said to be:
    - rate' = $\frac{D \ce{O2}}{D t} = $k'[\ce{NO2}]$
    - $2\frac{\ce{NO2}}{\ce{O2}} \rightarrow \text{rate} = \text{rate'} \times 2$
    - so $k[\ce{NO2}]^n = 2 \times k'[\ce{NO2}]^n$

## Types of Rate Laws
- differential rate law -- describes how rate depends on concentration ratio
- integrated rate law -- describes how rate depends on time
- for each type of differential rate law there is an integrate rate law and vice-versa
- rate laws can help understand reaction mechanisms

## Determining Rate Laws
- first step is to determine the form of the rate law (esp. its order)
- must be determined from experimental data
- \ce{2N2O5_{aq} + -> 4NO2_{(aq)} + O2_{(g)}}
- reverse won't play a role

- steps
    - gather data
    - graph data
    - then find the rate at the given point

- rate = $\frac{-D[\ce{N2O5}]}{D t} = k[\ce{N2O5}]^1 = k[\ce{N2O5}]$
    - twice rate at twice concentration
    - can only be determined by experimentation

## The Method of Initial Rates
- this method requires that a reaction be run several times
- the initial concentration of the reactans are varied
- the reaction ruate is measured best right after the reactants are mixed
    - eliminates the effects of reverse reaction

### Example
- for reaction
    - \ce{BrO3- + 5Br- + 6H+ -> 3Br2 + 3H2O}
- general form of rate law is
    - rate = $k[\ce{BrO3}]^{n}[\ce{Br-}]^{m}[\ce{H+}]^{k}$

- initial vs. average rate

## Integrated Rate Law
- expresses the reaction concentration as a function of time
- form of the equation depends on the order of the rate law
- changes rates = $\frac{\Delta [\text{A}]^n}{\Delta t}$
- (we will only work with n = 0,1,2)

## First Order
- for \ce{2N2O5 -> 4NO2 + O2}
    - found rate = $k[\ce{N2O5}]^1$
    - if concentration doubles, rate doubles
    - if we integrate this equation with respect to time, we get the *Integrated Rate Law*
    - $\ln{[\ce{N2O5}]} = -kt + \ln{[\ce{N2O5}]_{0}}$
        - ln -- natural log
        - $[\ce{N2O5}]_{0}$ -- initial concentration
    - general form: rate = $\frac{\Delta [A]}{\Delta t} = k[A]$
    - $\ln{[A]}$
    - in $y = mx + b$
        - $y = \ln{[A]}$
        - $x = t$
        - $m = -k$
        - $b = \ln{[A]_{0}}$
        - graph is a straight line
        - straight line --> first order
        - $\ln{[\frac{[A]_{0}}{[A]_{t}}]} = -kt$

### Half Life
- normal radioactive decay is first order
- t required to reach 1/2 concentration
- $[A] = \frac{[A]_{0}}{2}$ when $t = t_{1/2}$
- $ln{2} = kt_{1/2}$ $t_{1/2} \approx \frac{0.693}{k}$

## Second Order
- rate = $\frac{-\Delta [A]}{\Delta t} = k[A]^{2}$
- integrated rate law:
    - $\frac{1}{[A]} = kt + \frac{1}{[A]_{0}}$
- as $y = mx + b$
    - $y = \frac{1}{[A]}$
    - $x = t$
    - $m = k$
    - $b = \frac{1}{[A]_{0}}$
    - a straight line if $\frac{1}{[A]}$ vs. $t$ is graphed
    - knowing k and $[A]_{0}$ you can calculate at any time t

### Second Order Half Life
- $t_{1/2} = \frac{1}{k[A]_{0}}$

## Zero Order Rate Law
- rate = $k[A]_{0} = k$
- rate does not change with concentration
- integrated: $[A] = -kt + [A]_{0}$
- when $[A] = \frac{[A]_{0}}{2}$, $t = t_{1/2}$
- $t_{1/2} = \frac{[A]_{0}}{2k}$

- most often when reaction happens on a surface beacuase the surface area stays constant
- also applies to enzyme chemistry

## More Complex Reactions
- \ce{BrO3- + 5Br- + 6H+ -> 3Br2 + 3H2O}
- for this reaction, the rate law was found to be
    - rate = $k[\ce{BrO3}][\ce{Br-}][\ce{H+}]^{2}$
- to investigate rate, need to control variables
- set up the experiment so that two of the reactants are in large excess
- $[\ce{BrO3-}]_{0} = \SI{1.0e-3}{\Molar}$
- $[\ce{Br-}]_{0} = \SI{1.0}{\Molar}$
- $[\ce{H+}]_{0} = \SI{1.0}{\Molar}$
- concentration does not change significantly at \SI{1.0}{\Molar}
- rate = $k[\ce{BrO3-}][\ce{Br-}][\ce{H+}]^{2}$
- rate = $k[\ce{BrO3-}][\ce{Br-}]_{0}[\ce{H+}]_{0}^{2}$
- rate = $k[\ce{Br-}]_{0}[\ce{H+}]_{0}^{2}[\ce{BrO3-}]$
- rate = $k'[\ce{BrO3-}]$
    - pseudo first order rate law
- $k = \frac{k'}{[\ce{Br-}]_{0}[\ce{H+}]_{0}^{2}}$

## Reaction Mechanisms
- the series of steps that actually occur in a chemical reaction
- kinetics can tell us something about the mechanism
- A balanced reaction does not tell us how reactants become products

- \ce{2NO2 + F2 -> 2NO2F}
- rate = $k[\ce{NO2}][\ce{F2}]$
- proposed mechanism
    - \ce{NO2 + F2 -> NO2F + F} (slow)
    - \ce{F + NO2 -> NO2F} (fast)
- F is called an intermediate, it is formed then consumed in the reaction

- rate limiting step: related to the slowest subreaction (bottle neck)

- each of the two reactions is called an elementary step
- the rate for a reaction can be written from its molecularity
- molecularity -- the number of pieces tat must come together
    - unimolecular step -- one molecule involved -- rate is first order
    - bimolecular step -- two molecules involved -- rate is second order
    - termolecular step -- requires three molecules -- rate is third order
        - very rare (statistically improbable)

- $A$ $\rightarrow$ products -- rate = $k[A]$
- $A + A$ $\rightarrow$ products -- rate = $k[A]^2$
- $2A$ $\rightarrow$ products -- rate = $k[A]^2$
- $A + B$ $\rightarrow$ products -- rate = $k[A][B]$
- $A + A + B$ $\rightarrow$ products -- rate = $k[A]^{2}[B]$
- $A + B + C$ $\rightarrow$ products -- rate = $k[A][B][C]$

### How to Get Rid of Intermediates
- use the reactions that form them
- if reactions are fast and irreversible, the concentration of the intermediate is based on stoichiometry
- if it is formed by a reversible reaction, set the rates equal to each other
    - \ce{2NO + O2 -> 2NO2}
    - mechanism
        - \ce{2NO <=> N2O2} (fast)
        - \ce{N2O2 + O2 -> 2NO2} (slow)
    - rate = $k[\ce{N2O2}{O2}]$
    - $k_{1}[\ce{NO}]^{2} = k_{-1}[\ce{N2O2}]$
    - rate $k_{2}(\frac{k_{1}}{k_{-1}})[\ce{NO}]^{2}[\ce{O2}] = k[\ce{NO}]^{2}[\ce{O2}]$

### Formed in Fast Reactions
- \ce{2IBr -> I2 + Br2}
- mechanism
    - \ce{IBr -> I + Br} (fast)
    - \ce{IBr + Br -> I + Br2} (slow)
    - \ce{I + I -> I2} (fast)
- rate = $k[\ce{IBr}][\ce{Br}]$
    - but $[\ce{Br}] = [\ce{IBr}]$
    - rate = $k[\ce{IBr}]^2$

### Collision Theory
- molecules must collide to react
- concentration affects rate because collisions are more likely
- must collide hard enough
- temperature and rate are related
    - generally an increase in rate for an increase in temperature

### Terms
- activation energy -- energy needed to make a reaction happen
- activated complex/transition state -- intermediate step

### Arhenius
- said the reaction rate should increase with temperature
- at higher initial temperature there is more energy to get over the activation energy
- the number of collisions with the necessary energy increases exponentially
- number of collisions with the required energy = $ze^{\frac{-E_{a}}{RT}}$
    - $z$ -- total collisions
    - $e$ -- Euler's number
    - $E_{a}$ -- activation energy
    - $R$ -- ideal gas constant
    - $T$ -- temperature (Kelvin)

### Problems
- observed rate is a lot less than the number of collisions that have the minimum energy
- due to molecular orientation
- written into equation as p, *the steric factor*
- $k = zpe^{\frac{-E_{a}}{RT}} = Ae^{\frac{-E_{a}}{RT}}
    - A -- frequency factor = $zp$
    - $\ln{k} = (\frac{-E_{a}}{R}) \times \frac{1}{T} + \ln{A}$
    - $\ln{k}$ vs $t$ is a straight line

### Activation Energy and Rates
- activation energy for each step
- activation energy is determined by the rate constant ($k$)
- $k = Ae^{\frac{-E_{a}}{RT}}$ (Arrhenius)
- $k$ determines the rate
- slowest (rate determining) step must have the highest activation energy

## Catalysts
- speed up reaction without being used up
    - enzymes are biological catalysts
- homogeneous catalysts are in the same phase as the reactants
- heterogeneous catalysts are in a different phase than the reactants

### How Catalysts Work
- catalysts allow reactions to proceed by a different mechanism -- a new pathway
- new pathway has a lower activation energy
- more molecules will have this activation energy
- do not change $\Delta E$

### Homogeneous
- CFCs catalyze the decomposition of ozone
- enzymes regulate the body's processes (protein catalysts)

### Catalysts and Rate
- catalysts will speed up a reaction but only to a certain point
- pas a certain point, adding more reactants won't change the rate
- when the catalysts is full, the reaction rate becomes zero-order (flat line)
    - rate increases until the active sites of catalysts are filled
