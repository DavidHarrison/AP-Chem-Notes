# Chapter 6: Thermochemistry
## Energy
- the potential to do work
- comes in different forms, some potential (passive), and some kinetic (active)

## Formulas
- KE = 1/2 mv^2^
- PE = mgh
- $\Delta$ E = q + w (heat + work)
- W = Fd = -P $\Delta$ V

## Enthalpy
- $\Delta$ H at constant pressure is a measure of the heat flow of a system
- the change in enthalpy of a system is enthalpy of the products - enthalpy of the reactants
    - $\Delta$ H = F~final~ - H~initial~
- if $\Delta$ H is *positive*, the reaction is *endothermic*
- if $\Delta$ H is *negative*, the reaction is *exothermic*
- enthalpy is a state function

## $\Delta$ H of Reactions
- $\Delta$ H of reaction is often given in kJ/mol to find out how much energy was absorbed/released in a specific reaction, convert the mass used to moles
    - 2H~2(g)~ + O~2(g)~ -> 2H~2~O~(l)~ $\Delta$ H = -572 kJ/mol
    - reaction is exothermic ($\Delta$ H is negative)
- $\Delta$ H~f~^o^ - standard $\Delta$ H~formation~
    - standard enthalpy of formation: the change in enthalpy that accompanies the formation of one mole of a compound from its elements with all substances

## Definition of Standard State
- gas phase -- 1.0 atm
- solids and liquids -- pure
- solutions -- 1.0 M
- elements at 25^o^ C & 1 atm and normal phase -- $\Delta$ H~f~^o^ = 0
- value given per mole of product is in its standard state

## Rules for Finding $\Delta$ H~rxn~^o^
- *when reversing the reaction, the sign reverse*
- *when multiplying by an int the enthalpy is also multiplied by the same int*

(see Appendix 4 p.A19 for a table of $\Delta$ H~f~^o^)

- making bonds -> energy released
- breaking bonds -> energy taken in

**$\Delta$ H~rxn~^o^ = $\Sigma$ n~p~ $\Delta$ H~f~^o^ (products) - $\Sigma$ n~r~ $\Delta$ H~f~^o^ (reactants)**

## Calorimetry
- the study of measuring heat capacity: how much heat a substance can hold, or conversely, the amount of heat that must be absorbed to achieve and increase in temperature

### Specific Heat Capacity
- the amount of energy needed to raise 1 g of a substance 1^o^ C (J/g^o^C)
- molar heat capacity -- J/m^o^C

### Constant Pressure
- $\Delta$ H = q~p~ = mC $\Delta$ T
    - m = mass
    - c = specific heat
    - $\Delta$ T = change in temperature

- heat lost = heat gained
- constant volume
    - $\Delta$ E = q + w = heat + work
    - w = 0 -> $\Delta$ E = q

### Bomb Calorimeter
- allows for a constant volume

## Energy Is
- the ability to do work
- conserved
- made of heat and work
- a state function
- independent of the path
- work is force acting over a distance
- heat is energy transferred between objects because of temperature difference

## The Universe
- two halves:
- system and its surroundings
- the system is the part we are concerned with
- surroundings are the rest
- *exothermic reactions release energy to the surroundings*
- *endothermic reactions absorb their energy from the surroundings*

## Direction
- every energy measurement has three parts
    1. a unit (Joules/calories)
    2. a number (how many)
    3. a sign (to tell its direction)
        - (-) -> exothermic
        - (+) -> endothermic
