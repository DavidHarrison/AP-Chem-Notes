# Chapter 8: Bonding
- bonds hold atoms together
- we will look at them in terms of bond energy (the energy required to break a bond)
- compounds are formed producing a lower (and more stable) energy state

## Ionic Bonding
- metal and non-metal
- energy by Coulomb's Law ($E = k\frac{Q_{1}Q_{2}}{r^{2}}$)
    - Q -- charge
    - r -- distance between centers
    - charges opposite -> energy is negative -> exothermic
    - same charges -> energy is positive -> endothermic

## Covalent Bonding
- the electrons in each atom are attracted to the nucleus of each other
- the electrons repel each other
- the nuclei repel each other
- they reach a distance with the lowest possible energy (bond length)
- electrons are shared
- between ionic and covalent are polar covalent bonds
    - the electrons are not shared evenly
    - one end is slighly positive, the other negative (indicated by $\delta \pm$)
        - $\ce{H^{\delta}+\bond{-}F^{\delta}-}$

## Electronegativity
- the ability of an atom to attract shared electrons to itself
- Pauling method
    - imaginary molecule \ce{HX} (\ce{HA})
        - expected \ce{H\bond{-}X} energy = $\frac{\text{\ce{H\bond{-}H} energy} + \text{\ce{H\bond{-}H} energy}}{2}$
- $\Delta = (\ce{H\bond{-}X})_{\text{actual}} - (\ce{H\bond{-}X})_{\text{theoretical}}$
- $\Delta$ is known for almost every element
- gives us relative electronegativities of all elements
- on the periodic table:
    - tends to increase left to right
    - decreases going down a group
        - noble gases excluded
- $\Delta$ electronegativity tells us about the polarity of their bonds
    - zero electronegativity -- (non-polar) covalent
    - medium electronegativity -- polar covalent
    - large electronegativity -- ionic

## Dipole Method
- a molecule with a center of negative charge and a center of positive charge is dipolar (two poles)
- or has a "dipole moment"
- center of charge does not have to be on the atom

- drawndd
### Which Molecules have Dipoles
- any two atoms or molecules with a polar bond
- with three or more atoms there are a variety of ways for the bonds not to cancel (even angles, non-planar, bent etc.)
- atoms tend to react to form noble gas configuration
- metals lose electrons to form cations
- non-metals can store electrons in covalent bonds

## Ionic Compounds
- solid crystal
- alignment maximizes attraction and minimizes repulsion (minimizes potential energy)
- can stabilize ions that would be unstable as gases
- react to achieve noble gas configuration

## Size of Ions
- ion size increases down a group
- cations are smaller than the atoms they came from
- anions are larger
- across a row on the periodic table, size gets smaller then suddenly larger
    - first half -- cations
    - second half -- anions

## Periodic Trends
- across the period nuclear charge increases so they get smaller
- energy level changes between anions an cations

## Size of Isoelectronic Ions
- iso -- smae
- isoelectronic ions have the same number of electrons
- by increasing size: \ce{Al^{3+} Mg^{2+} Na^{+} Ne F^{-} O^{2-} N^{3-}}
    - all same electron configuration (10 electrons, $1s^{2}2s^{2}2p^{6}$)

## Forming Ionic Compounds
- lattice energy -- energy associated with making a solid ionic compound from its gaseous ions
- \ce{M^{+}_{(g)} + X^{-}_{(g)} -> MX_{(s)}}
- this energy "pays" for making the compounds
- energy is a state function

- \ce{Na_{(s)} + 1/2F2_{(g)} -> NaF_{(s)}}
- first stabilize \ce{Na}
    - \ce{Na_{(s)} -> Na_{(g)}}
    - $\Delta H = \SI{109}{\kilo\joule\per\mole}$
- ionize \ce{Na_{(g)}}
    - \ce{Na_{(g)} -> Na^{+}_{(g)} + e-}
    - $\Delta H = \SI{495}{\kilo\joule\per\mole}$
- break \ce{F\bond{-}F} bond
    - \ce{1/2F2_{(g)} -> F_{(g)}
    - $\Delta H = \SI{77}{\kilo\joule\per\mole}$
- add \ce{e-} to \ce{F}
    - \ce{F_{(g)} + e- -> F-_{(g)}}
    - $\Delta H = \SI{-328}{\kilo\joule\per\mole}$
- lattice energy
    - \ce{Na_{(s)} + 1/2F2_{(g)} -> NaF_{(s)}}
    - $\Delta H = \SI{-928}{\kilo\joule\per\mole}$

### Calculate Lattice Energy
- lattice energy = $k(Q_{1}Q_{2}/r)$
    - $k$ -- constant dependent on structure of crystals
    - $Q$s -- charges
    - $r$ -- nuclear distance
- lattice energy is greater with a more highly charged ion
- this bigger lattice energy "pays" for the ionization energy

## Partial Ionic Character
- there are probably not totally ionic bonds between individual atoms
- percent ionic character can be calculated
    - compare measured dipole of \ce{X\bond{-}Y} bonds to calculate dipole of \ce{X^{+}Y^{-}} the completely ionic case
    - percent dipole = $\frac{\text{measured \ce{X\bond{-}Y}}}{\text{calculated \ce{X^{+}Y^{-}}}} \times 100$
- if bonds can't be ionic, what are ionic compounds?
    - an ionic compound will be defined as any substance that conducts electricity when melted
        - also use the generic term salt

## The Covalent Bond
- forces that cause a group of atoms to behave as a unit
- due to the tendency of atoms to achieve th lowest energy state
- bond energy = $\frac{E_{\text{total}}}{\text{bonds (of same type)}}$
- the cond is a human invention
    - method for explaining how molecules are formed
    - not in nature, but useful

## What is a Model
- explains nature
- derived from observations
- simplifies theory and categorizes the information
- will always have limits/exceptions
- can be wrong (speculations/oversimplifications)
- become more complex with age
- we learn more from when models break than when they work

- actually, each bond (including those of the same type) will have different energies
    - each bond is sensitive to the environment

- covalent bonds -- \ce{e-} shared for each bond
    - each successive bond is shorter

- takes energy to break bonds
- gives off energy when bonds are formed

## Localized Electron Model
- simple model, easily applied
- a molecule is a composition of atoms that are bound together by sharing electrons
- three parts
    1. valence electrons using Lewis structures
    2. prediction of geometry using VSEPR
    3. description of types of orbitals

## Lewis Structure
- shows how the valence electrons are arranged
- one dot for each valence electron
- a stable compound has all its atoms with a noble gas configuration
- hydrogen follows the duet rule
- rest follow octent guidline (with exceptions)

### Rules
- sum the valen electons
- use a pair to form a bond between each pair of atoms
- arrange the rest to fulfill the octet "rule" (except for H and the duet)

### Exceptions to the Octet
- \ce{BH3} (6 electrons -> stable)
- \ce{Be} and \ce{B} often do not achieve the octet
- \ce{SF6} exceeds the octet
- third row and larger elements can exceed the octet
- when the octet is exceeded, the extra electrons go to the central atom
- balance using formal charge
    - formal charge = $\text{valence electrons} - \text{non-bonding electrons} -\frac{\text{bonding electrons}}{2}$

### Resonance
- sometimes, there is more than one valid structure for a molecule or ion (ex. \ce{NO3^{-}})
- use double arrows to show the "average" of the structures
- doesn't switch between
- localized electron model based on pairs, so it does not work for unpaire electrons
- negative formal charges should be on electronegative elements
- molecules minimize formal charce

## VSEPR
- Lewis structures tell us how the atoms are connected to each other, but not about the shape/geometry
- shape of molecules can greatly affect properties
- molecules take on a shape that puts eelctron pairs as far away from each other as possible
- have to draw Lewis structure to determine bonding
    - pairs (bonding, non-bonding lone)
    - lone pairs take up more space
    - multiple bonds count as one pair
    - number of pairs determine
        - bond angles
        - underlying structure
    - number of atoms determine
        - actual shape

| bonding electron pairs | bond angle (degrees) |  underlying shape    |
|------------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| 2                      | 180                  | linear               |

| 6                      | 90                   | octagonal            |

|----------------|---------------|-------------------|----------------------|

| 6              | 6             | 0                 | octahedral           |

### No Central Atom
- can predict geometry of each atom
- build it piece by piece

- model does well, predictions almost always accurate
    - has exceptions

- atomic orbitals don't work to explain molecular geometry
- in methane, \ce{CH4}, the shape is tetrahedral
- the valence electron of \ce{C} should be 2 in s and 2 in p
- the p orbitals would have to be at $90^{\circ}$ angles
- the atomic orbitals change when making a molecule

## Hybridization
- we blend the s and p orbitals of the valence electrons and end up with the tetrahedral geometry
- we combine one s orbital and 3 p orbitals
- we know geometry from experimentation
- we know the orbitals of the atoms
- hybridizing atomic orbitals can explain the geometry
- so, if the geometry requires a tetrahedral shape, it is sp$^{3}$ hybridized
