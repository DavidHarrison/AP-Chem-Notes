## Hybridization
- sp^2 hybridization
    - 3 things\
    - 1 \sigma 1 \pi bonds
- sp hybridization
    - 2 things
    - 1 \sigma 2 \pi bonds
    - makes room for 2 \pi bonds and 2 \sigma bonds
    - a triple bond or 2 double bonds
(see figure)

## Breaking the Octet
- dsp3 hybridization
    - 5 things
    - trigonal bipyramidal
    - can only form \sigma bonds
    - *can't* form \pi bonds
    - basic shape for five things
- PCl5
    - model predicts that we must use the d orbitals
    - dsp3 hybridization
    - some controversy
    - can't tell the hybridization of Cl
        - assume sp3 to minimize repulsion of e- pairs
- d2sp3 hybridization
    - 6 things
    - octahedral

## Molecular Orbital Model
- localized model we have learned explains much about bonding
- it doesn't deal well with the idea of resonance, unpaired e-, and bond energy
- the MO (molecular orbital) model is a parallel of the atomic orbital using quantum mechanics
- each MO can hold 2 e- with opposite spins
- square of wave function tells probability

## What do you get?
- solve equations for H~2~
- H~A~ - H~B~
- get 2 orbitals
- MO~1~ = 1S~A~ - 1S~B~
- MO~2~ = 1S~A~ + 1S~B~

- the molecular orbitals are centered on a line through the nuclei
    - MO~1~, the greatest probability is between nuclei
    - MO~2~ is on either side of the nuclei
    - this shape is called a sigma molecular orbital
- in the molecule, only the molecular orbitals exist, the atomic orbitals are gone
- MO~1~ is lower in energy than the 1s orbitals they come from
    - favors molecule formation
    - called a bonding orbital
- MO~2~ is higher in energy
    - this goes against bonding
    - anti-bonding orbital

Energy diagram (see figure)

- we use labels to indicate shapes and whether the MOs are bonding or antibonding
    - MO~1~ = \sigma~1s~
    - MO~2~ = \sigma~1s\*~ (\* indicates antibonding)
- can write them the same way as atomic orbitals
    - H~2~ = 1\sigma~1s^2^~
- each MO can hold two electrons, but they must have opposite spins
- orbitals are conserved (# of molecular orbitals = # of atomic orbitals)

Energy diagram (see figure)

## Bond Order
- bond order = (# bonding - # antibonding)/2
- indicates strength and length

## Paramagnetism
- consequence of unpaired e-
- O2 is paramagnetic, N2 is not
- O2 contains 2 unpaired e- in the \pi~2p\*~ antibonding MO
- N2 has 2 pairs in the \pi~2p~ MO

- d orbitals do not form molecular orbitals
